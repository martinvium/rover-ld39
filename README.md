Ludum Dare 39

Theme: Running out of Power

Collect samples from the planet you were send to explore. Transmit them back to
headquarter before the sun goes away and your drained batteries will wipe the
rover's memory.

Post-morten:

Not successful. The core loop is kind of broken, and not fun. Getting a full
game loop early on would have avoided this.

My alternate idea was to have e.g. 8 different types of materials under the
surface that needs to be analyzed. And a ninth that would serve as fuel. Get
rid of the day cycle, and headquarter connection, and be all alone. Add probes
and directional scanner to reveal the materials under the surface for 1 turn.
